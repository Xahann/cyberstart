19991 is a closed port


A seperate NMAP scan reveals

pyftpdlib server on port 2121


need a USER and PASS to do anything interesting there however.


ending here, not sure what to do


picked it back up with a UDP nmap scan on that port, it's open on UDP

connecting with nc -u and sending some data gives us the flag
