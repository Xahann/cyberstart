Good news agent, another intercepted file for you to analyse that we think contains the access code to a safe the gang have on their boat - our undercover agent thinks he can get physical access to it, so we need the code as soon as possible.

We've tried executing the file and it loads the encrypted access code into memory. That's as far as we've got, give it a try and see if you can decrypt the code.

Tip: The decrypted code is the flag.
